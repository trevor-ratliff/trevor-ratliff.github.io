To whom it may concern:

I've been a web developer since 2000, I've experienced working in a number of different stacks during that time.  I have been an influential member to all the teams I've been on through my ability to see many possibilities and being able to help guide the team to the best coarse of action.  Helping people do what they love to do better and easier is something I love doing.  I have tackled many large scale systems through my career such as an intranet suite that included time keeping, project management, purchase tracking, travel management and reimbursements and other modules.

I would bring a broad range of skills to your company, including:

• 16 years of programming experience
• .Net languages of ASP.Net, VB.Net and C# as well as C, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, jQuery
• 14 years of SQL databases (MS SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle) 
• a knowledge that most programming languages are so similar in their capabilities, it's mostly syntax that's different.  Moving around between languages isn't that difficult when you can recognize the constructs and what they're doing.

I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss this position with you. If you have questions, or when you want to schedule an interview, please contact me by phone at 859-257-8304 (work) or 859-428-8760 (cell) or by e-mail at trevor.w.ratliff@gmail.com. I have enclosed my resume for your review, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Trevor Ratliff
